\section{Methods}

\subsection{Specimen Collection}
Talk in this section about where specimens were collected, by whom, and where processed. 

Want to add the section about new species?

\subsection{mtDNA amplification and sequencing}
Talk in this section about how the mitochondrial genomes were generated - long PCR? Illumina? Give me your wisdom. 

\subsection{Genome annotation}
Talk in this section about how the genomes were annotated and genes were identified? BLAST? tRNA-scanner? This section could possibly go with mtDNA amplification and sequencing. Unsure of if sections should be different.

\subsection{Codon Bias Analysis}
Talk in this section about using the genomes to look at codon bias/usage.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pull out all protein coding regions from mitochondrial genomes using pepper in cusp files
    \item Use custom Perl script to turn protein sequences into codon tables
    \item Analyse using custom R scripts that look at codon ending bias, and codon usage in proteins
\end{enumerate}
